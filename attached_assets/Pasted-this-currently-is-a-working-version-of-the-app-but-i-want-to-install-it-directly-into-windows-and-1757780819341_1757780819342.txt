this, currently, is a working version of the app

but i want to install it directly into windows and not use it through vscode

so before that, i would like some optimizations

these are the ones i had in mind:

1. Remove Debug/Console Output
Many print statements throughout the code that will clutter user experience
URL filter logs showing every allowed/blocked request in console
Traceback prints that expose technical details to users
2. Memory Optimization
Profile sharing efficiency: Each workspace creates a new QWebEngineProfile, but you could optimize shared resources
Tab restoration memory: Closed tabs are stored indefinitely in memory
üéØ Performance & Size Optimizations
3. PyInstaller Build Refinements
UPX compression exclusions could be more targeted
Hidden imports might include unnecessary modules
Bundle size could be reduced by excluding more unused dependencies
4. Resource Management
Auto-save frequency: 4-minute auto-save might be excessive for SSD wear
Notepad file handling: Could batch writes to reduce I/O
üîß User Experience Polish
5. Error Handling Improvements
Silent failures in some session loading scenarios
No user feedback when URL requests are blocked
Missing progress indicators during startup
6. Keyboard Shortcuts Refinement
No visual shortcuts help for users
Missing common browser shortcuts (Ctrl+R refresh, etc.)
üõ°Ô∏è Security & Stability
7. URL Filter Hardening
OAuth redirect validation could be more robust
Subdomain wildcarding might be too permissive
8. Session Recovery
No corrupt session handling if JSON files get damaged
Missing backup/restore functionality
üì± Platform Integration
9. Windows Integration
No file associations for .html files
Missing Windows notifications for session saves
No system tray integration for minimal operation
üíæ Memory Efficiency Focus
Since you emphasized memory efficiency is the biggest requirement:

10. WebEngine Memory Management
Shared process optimization: Configure QtWebEngine for minimal memory footprint
Cache size limits: Set explicit limits on profile cache sizes
Resource cleanup timing: More aggressive cleanup of unused resources
